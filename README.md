# pizzaria-ramos-api

A small Django API to manage pizzas.

## Quick setup

Just issue a `pipenv install`, another `python manage.py migrate` and you're
good to `python manage.py runserver`!

In order to store data, it uses a local SQLite database file. No need to
mess with your system :)

## APIs

As everything is graciously generated by Django REST Framework's ViewSets, this application features the following routes:

1. GET /pizzas/ - list all pizzas
2. GET /pizzas/<insert-pizza-id> - retrieve pizza by ID
3. GET /pizzas/?search=<insert-pizza-name> - search pizzas by name (case-insensitive)
4. POST /pizzas/ - creates a new pizza
5. PATCH /pizzas/<insert-pizza-id> - updates a pizza (partial, you just need to send what you want to change)
6. PUT /pizzas/<insert-pizza-id> - updates a pizza (full, you need to send everything)
7. DELETE /pizzas/<insert-pizza-id> - deletes a pizza
