# pizzaria-ramos-api
A small Django API to manage pizzas.

## Quick setup
Just issue a `pip install -r requirements.txt` and you're almost good to go!

In order to store data, you need MySQL installed and a database (obviously).

This application is configured with the following default settings (if you're using XAMPP, remember that it comes without password by default):
```
'default': {
    'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
    'NAME': 'pizzaria_ramos_db',
    'USER': 'root',
    'PASSWORD': 'root',
    'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
    'PORT': '3306',
}
```

## APIs

As everything is graciously generated by Django REST Framework's ViewSets, this application features the following routes:

1. GET /pizzas/ - list all pizzas
2. GET /pizzas/<insert-pizza-id> - retrieve pizza by ID
3. GET /pizzas/?search=<insert-pizza-name> - search pizzas by name (case-insensitive)
4. POST /pizzas/ - creates a new pizza
5. PATCH /pizzas/<insert-pizza-id> - updates a pizza (partial, you just need to send what you want to change)
6. PUT /pizzas/<insert-pizza-id> - updates a pizza (full, you need to send everything)
7. DELETE /pizzas/<insert-pizza-id> - deletes a pizza
